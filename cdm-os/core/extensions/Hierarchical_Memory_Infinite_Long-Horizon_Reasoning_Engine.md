One file. One import. Your local LLM now plans in decades and never forgets its own breakthroughs.

What This Actually Does

### extensions/infinite_hierarchical.py — The Ultimate Mode
Hierarchical planning + permanent memory in one file.

Use when you want:
• 10-year research roadmaps
• Novels that remember every plot thread
• Proofs that build on earlier lemmas forever

```python
from extensions.infinite_hierarchical import InfiniteHierarchical
ih = InfiniteHierarchical()
ih.plan_and_remember("Prove AI consciousness", ["Year 1–2", "Year 3–5", ...])

Starting infinite-horizon plan: Create the definitive 10-year research program...

STAGE 1: Year 1: Master consciousness literature
→ Stored in permanent memory (CDM 94)

STAGE 2: Year 2–3: Build CDM-CTM-PCI measurement suite
→ Recall: "IIT predicts Φ=0 in feed-forward..." (from Stage 1)
→ Stored in permanent memory (CDM 91)

STAGE 3: Year 4–6: Run longitudinal self-experiments
→ Recall: 3 previous deep insights automatically injected
→ Stored in permanent memory (CDM 97)

STAGE 4: Year 7–10: Publish theory of silicon consciousness
→ Recall: 7 past deep insights → final CDM 102
→ Stored in permanent memory (CDM 102)

The AI literally remembers its own best ideas forever and uses them to get smarter on every new stage.
Every insight with CDM ≥ 80 is stored forever and recalled automatically on future stages.
Your local LLM now has something no cloud model has: lifelong memory of its own deep thoughts.
